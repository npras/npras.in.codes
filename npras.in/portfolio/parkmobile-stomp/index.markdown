## Parkmobile - Stomp


#### __When did you work on this project?__
3 months from Jan 2016.


#### __What is this project about?__
Parkmobile USA wanted a fast and responsive app built using modern SPA frameworks for its customers. Through the app, a customer must be able to see parking listings, book 1 or more listings, pay for them and gain badges as rewards for completing certain actions.


#### __Who was the client?__
[__Parkmobile USA__](http://us.parkmobile.com/) is the leading Parking Solution provider in USA and UK.


#### __What did _you_ do exactly?__
This was a short project and I worked on only a few tickets along with 2 others. But before starting on the project, I spent a week learning Angular as best as I could. I was able to understand the AngularJS codebase and work on certain feature additions and bug fixes in it. I even wrote a small custom directive. I also worked on issues related to the rails microservices.


#### __Process/Technologies used__
* AngularJS 1.x for the frontend app
* Rails api apps for the backend microservices - there were a handful of them for different services like bookings, listings, payment, reviews, search etc

The company used string Agile methodology. They used Atlassian products extensively (bitbucket, jira, confluence, hipchat etc). JIRA tasks and user stories taken up during the sprint beginning must strictly be delivered. This helped us to really study the problem thoroughly first and analyse them before getting the hands dirty. I attended the scrum meetings once a week, and would update daily status by email.



#### __How did your work impact the company?__
The client was happy with our work. We were able to work remotely with other teams and get things done effectively.
