## Mozo App


#### __When did you work on this project?__
8 months from April to November 2017.


#### __What is this project about?__
Mozo is a product review site that reviews a lot of financial products like loans, credit cards, insurance policies etc. Their main app is a rails app with a lot of mini react apps, with data coming from a different api app. The ongoing business requirements for the app would reach us as development tasks, which we'll then develop and ship.


#### __Who was the client?__
[__Mozo Australia__](http://mozo.com.au/).


#### __What did _you_ do exactly?__
* managed the remote team from Chennai
* worked on creating a new CMS for Mozo's admin app that would help content creators to publish articles of various types
* created a react app from scratch that would fetch data from Mozo's api
* wrote code that would get the live price details from all available insurance providers (from their apis).
* created new rails code that would help Mozo organize a [blogger competition](http://mozo.com.au/insurance/travel-insurance/best-20)
* reported the offshore team's work during weekly scrum calls to Mozo's CTO


#### __Process/Technologies Used__
* Rails 4, Ruby 2.3, MySql 5.6
* React 15, redux, redux-form, redux-saga, react-select
* MacOS for development, Ubuntu for server
* Agile approach with weekly scrum meetings with the client
* Since the client was from Australia, I worked remotely in the project.


#### __How did your work impact the company?__
My work at the admin side of Mozo's main app was instrumental in getting custom-built articles published at lightspeed. Those articles in turn affect Mozo's bottomline directly. The admin work was also helpful in automating a lot of work for the content creators.

The react app I built was for one of Mozo's partners. The app would help showcase different credit cards and give the user the ability to do side-by-side comparison based on a lot of criteria. The app had "Go to site" kind of buttons that, when clicked, would help earn commission on referrals for the partner site.


#### __Was the client happy?__
The client was happy with the work we did. Their involvement would stop after giving us the specs for a particular project. I'd take it from there to split it into action items, creating github issues, briefing the offshore team and then finally building and delivering the actual project item.

I also had to learn ReactJS to build an app from scratch. The client was particularly happy about this one as I did not trouble the onsite team with any assistance seeking.
