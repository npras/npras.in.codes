#### Side Projects
Here are some of the projects that I've built outside of client work.

* [__Kindle Pras__](https://github.com/npras/kindle_pras): A ruby command-line application that I use regularly to extract highlights from my Kindle. The generated markdown files are used to feed my [Book Notes site](http://books.npras.in).
