excerpt: "I wanted to see how Javascript experts code. Evan You, the VueJS creator is the expert here."

VueJS is a hot choice today when it comes to SPAs. It makes sense for a developer to spend time learning its APIs. But tomorrow, another framework might become the new hot, just like Ember, Backbone and Angular were in the past. So what's the point of learning these framework APIs? Sure, we get to make money out of it by building amazing apps for our clients, but in the long run, I think learning about _how_ the API was designed will make us better programmers.

Here's a video I made exploring the [__VueJS Source code__](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

Having just finished [__this book__](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6) about ES6, going through the codebase of an app written in my _secondary language_ felt surprisingly easier.

In the same vein, I've also made a few blog posts about VueJS source:

* [__VueJS: Implementing Proxy behaviour of Data object__](/vuejs-proxy-data-object/)
* [__VueJS: Implementing Computed properties__](/vuejs-implementing-computed/)
