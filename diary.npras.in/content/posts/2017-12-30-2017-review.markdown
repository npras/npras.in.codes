#### Creations
31 blog posts at my tech blog: [tech blog](https://tech.npras.in/). I thought it was great, but I had the exact same number in 2016 too. Need to have more by next year. Or should I? What value am I getting out of these?

#### Consumptions
8 books and 2 tech books.

1. The Road Less Travelled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth by Scott M
2. HPMOR
3. Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday
4. Millionaire Fastlane by MJ
5. Worm by Wildbow
6. Solving the Procrastination Puzzle by Timothy A
7. GTD for hackers
8. Jonathan Livingston Seagull

1. Fullstack React
2. Mastering PostgreSQL

You can see some of my reviews at [book review blog](https://books.npras.in/).

And a whopping __32 tamil movies__ and some __5+ english movies__.


The create to consume ratio isn't to my liking now. I'll have to build habits to increase creation and reduce consumption.

#### Learnings
1. Udemy google sheets
2. Udemy ethical hacking
3. Some hindi


#### Side projects
None.

This is ridiculous. Need to have something worthy hear this time next year.
