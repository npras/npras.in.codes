title: "Ray Dalio Decision Framework"

In his Principles book, Ray Dalio shares a short heuristic on how we have to take decisions. It's just 5 points to remember. Once you are able to apply one or more of these to all or most of the decisions - or at least to the important ones - you'll be able to lead a successful and rewarding life.


### 1) It is BAD to allow pain to stand in the way of my progress. It is GOOD to understand how to manage pain to produce progress.

It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way.

Nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we have exceeded, our limits in some way. At the same time, nature made the process of getting stronger require us to push our limits. Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the body and the mind to encountering one’s limits, which is painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from encountering one’s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our decision-making process.

> Pain + Reflection = Progress


### 2) It is BAD to avoid facing "harsh realities". It is GOOD to face "harsh realities".

people who know that understanding what is real is the first step toward optimally dealing with it make better decisions.


### 3) It is BAD to worry about appearing good. It is GOOD to worry about achieving your goal.

People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future.

People who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident that they have the best possible answers.


### 4) It is BAD to make my decisions on the basis of first-order consequences. It is GOOD to make my decisions on the basis of first-, second- and third- order consequences.

People who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects that the second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their goals.

For example, the first- order consequences of exercise (pain and time-sink) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food that tastes good is often bad for you and vice versa, etc. If your goal is to get physically fit and you don’t ignore the first-order consequences of exercise and good-tasting but unhealthy food and connect your decisions with their second- and third-order consequences, you will not reach your goal.

Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes they are barriers that stand in our way of getting what we want. **It’s almost as though the natural selection process sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing the dummies who make their decisions just on the basis of the first-order consequences alone.**


### 5) It is BAD to not hold myself accountable. It is GOOD to hold myself accountable.

People who blame bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than themselves are behaving in a way that is at variance with reality and subversive to their progress.

Blaming bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than one’s self is essentially wishing that reality is different than it is, which is silly. And it is subversive because it diverts one’s attention away from mustering up the personal strength and other qualities that are required to produce the best possible outcomes.

Successful people understand that bad things come at everyone and that it is their responsibility to make their lives what they want them to be by successfully dealing with whatever challenges they face. Successful people know that nature is testing them, and that it is not sympathetic.


## Thoughts
These insights are extremely eye-opening for me. I need to find a way to practice these in my day-to-day life, and I'm not sure how. Ideally these should become automatic. A habit. So to build a new habit, I'll have to start by practicing it.

I can think of a way to practice point 4 right away. I'm right now trying to exercise daily, at around the same time - right after I wake up and finish my morning routines. Most of the days I wish **not** to exercise. It's either because of the cold weather, or because of the soreness from previous day's workout. But, from now on, I'll have to think of Ray Dalio's this 4th point - "Don't make decisions based on their 1st order consequences, but based on further order consequences". Remembering this, I will be able to push through the mind chatter and finish the workout. I'll have to remember that the workout is only trying to help and improve me by making me strong and improve my appearance.

Reg point 5: I've made the mistake of blaming others for my failures more than once. When I speak my mind out on this, which is most often, I invariably hurt deeply the other person. I HAVE to stop this. How do I make this a habit? Can I write Scott Adam's style affirmations for a while until the thought is grooved into my brain? That is a good idea. I have been using 1 affirmation for the past 1 year, and I can see it taking effect. So even this might work. But decide first what affirmation, and when and how you'll practice. Another way to embed this point into me: In my journal, list down all the things I've blamed in others in the past. And see how holding myself accountable in those situations would have strengthened and improved me.

I don't have the time now to think about the other 3 points. Will have to get back to them later.

But again, remember to work on 4 and 5, as I seem to have found ways to try them out. What's important though, is I have to try them actually.
