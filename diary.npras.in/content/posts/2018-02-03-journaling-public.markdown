I don't know where to begin.

If I had a kid, I'll impose upon him many "ways to live". But why take a back seat while the kid get to have a great life? I myself want more out of life and I'll strive to do what I want my kid to do.

The best use of 90% of awake time is to either create or learn something. (The 10% is for things like relationships and doing life's essential drudge work such as paying bills). I added consumption at the end of list - you first create value, then learn about your reality and then consume what you want to. But then [Derek Siver says here](http://sivers.org/about) says he only does 2 things: create stuff and learn stuff. I want to live my life like that.

My biggest goal in life is to simply become rich. For that I need to create value that impacts a lot of people. To create value, I can use my existing skillsets, which is mediocre at best, or learn new stuff and become more valuable that I'm able to create value for other people. Consumption gets in the way. I'm consuming the internet's best products like a drug addict. Youtube, chess, movies, reddit etc. These stuff are so good and they are intervening directly with my ability to learn and create.

So a focus on these 2 is important. At worst, if I can't create any useful value for people, I'll at least spend my time learning new things.

I'm currently learning a css course and reading a book about mindful meditation. Just a while ago, I also was furiously bent on improving my chess.com score. The internet has no shortage of great chess education stuff. Pouring over them got me from a score of 1200 to 1600. But I'm learning nothing here. Chess is on par with drugs in terms of addiction if you really grok it, like I did.

I notice that this post is no more about my kid.

I'm 31 now and haven't accomplished anything worthwhile. Not even a baby. 

Wait. That's not an "accomplishment". It's a huge burden in that it is now upon you to make sure this kid has everything he'd need to survive and thrive in this world. The baby didn't ask to be born. Your own selfishness only brings it here alive. You are responsible to make sure it has the right worldview.

Btw, what is a correct worldview? If I know, then my life would have been better now. But wait, I'm onto something now and maybe this will change things.

My writing is so incoherent. I can't articulate what I want to say. I need to write more. I need to practice writing too. Practice by writing on specific things.

Ok. Now I've got an idea. I'll next write specifically about managing distractions.
