title: "Managing distractions"

My waking moments should be spent in pursuit of my goals and plans. It might take any of these forms:

* working on a side project that could create value
* learn an essential skill
* be focused and get things done at work
* plan a small or large aspect of your life and do the work necessary to get things done


It shouldn't be spent doing these things:

* wallowing in depression. So many things to worry about. I got cheated out of Rs 6 lacs. It's now been more than a year and I think I haven't gotten over it. The harrowing experience changed my life, in a bad way. (another topic to blog about).

* consuming stuff - movies, youtube videos, even some unnecessary books, social media, general internet like reddit (and porn). Very occasional consumption is fine I guess? To that extent, I'm tracking all the movies I'm watching this year. Last year I counted over 30+ movies which I think is bad.


So I need to take hold of consumptions and replace them with creations.

I need to find a way to deal with the addictions and distractions.

What won't work:

* running blocking softwares like self control, rescue time, deleting chess.com account etc.

What will work (I think):

* being mindful, at least to the ability where I catch myself in the middle of these misgivings and then have the strength to shut them down. So I think mindfulness will help.
* this. Blogging about what I feel, sharing my vulnerabilities and striving for a better life. This I think might help too.
* training my brain to ignore them even when they are right before me. I haven't uninstalled chess from my ipad, but it's been more than a week since I opened it.
* The edw519 idea. Always be in the middle of some constructive work so that when you have time, it's easy to jump into these constructive works rather than getting overwhelmed about what to start and then not starting anything and instead consuming stuff. Renewing this blog was one such thing. I now have a place to go quickly and write down whatever I want and "ruminate" instead of binge watching louis ck in youtube.

Maybe properly beeminding certain key habits?

No. No. NO.

The problem is not about managing distractions. It's about finding a thing that I love.

Remember the time I was in love? Yes, it was around 2010 or 2011 when I started getting into ruby out of nowhere. I did a lot of exploratory learning and that kept me passionate. The one mistake I did then? I didn't plan for the long haul? Should've expected this slump and pivoted my skills.

Nothing's wrong now. What can I do now?

The one thing I really want to do is explore open source code and learn a lot from them.

But wait, that's another topic.
