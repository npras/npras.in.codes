[This detailed guest post about writing winning emails](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/guide-to-writing-client-emails/) by Robert Williams was super informative. I'm just detailing the gist of it here.

When you send a bad email you’re telling a client you can’t be bothered to figure out how you’re valuable.

Great client emails mean:
* More money for you
* More chances to explore your best ideas
* Less back-and-forth hassle and time-wasting


### Your Biggest Competition
...is yourself. Most freelancers and consultants eliminate themselves before they ever get told “no” by a client.

>  “Why bother? This person is probably getting pitched a hundred times a day… I won’t be first, so it’s useless. Hundreds of more experienced freelancers have already contacted this person. I don’t have a chance.”

The truth is, being first isn’t a great position when it comes to email. I’ve studied clients who post on my private job board and they rarely go with the first person to email them.


### Email Goal #1: Educating your clients
If you’re waiting for leads to come in with huge budgets and projects that match your skills perfectly, forget about it. It’s not going to happen.

You have to make educating clients a priority. Ideal clients aren’t born; they’re created by great consultants who teach them. That’s why some people triple their client’s budget while others are stuck giving discounts.

The truth is, if you’re a consultant, any job post or inbound inquiry is a request for your help educating on what the right solution to a problem is.

The most successful consultants get this. Instead of complaining about low budgets, they show clients how working with them is in their best interest.


### How to make a connection quickly
Has the recipient written a book or blog post you can read? If so, read it. Learn their name. Lead with something you really love about their company. Sincerely discovering what YOU think is great about them will not only feel good it will result in 10x the results. Remember, as your future client reads each sentence, they only have two options:

* Stop reading.
* Keep reading.

Give them a reason to choose #2 by stepping into their shoes.


### How to get your emails read
>   Subject: Hey Robert, I want to help you find high-quality leads for consultancies.

If I received an email with this title, I’d open it immediately. Whoever sent this email knows who I am and what I do. This means they couldn’t send this email to just anyone. It means this isn’t spam.

Lead with something you know they’ll find interesting and shows you actually know something about them.


### Should you send your portfolio?
what happens if you don’t send it?

It means a potential client will have to ask to see it. This allows you to keep track of every single person who sees your work. Sending your portfolio to each individual client will put an emphasis on the words you use to describe your work.  

It also lets you tailor exactly what they’ll see depending on their current needs. You can craft an offer specifically designed for the person you’re currently talking to.

You’ll also naturally avoid client-repelling terms others use in their portfolios because saying things like “user interface designer” or “experienced web developer” comes off awkward and impersonal.


### Sell an outcome, not yourself.
>   I’ve helped hundreds of businesses in your position. I helped X-company to accomplish Y-benefit.
would become:
>   Your website reminds me of past client of mine: X-company, which probably means you want Y-benefit as well.


### What else to leave out
I also recommend you don’t include links to your social media or blog. A prospective client doesn’t care about your work yet.

The only point of your email is to get them to reply. Making them click on your website, linkedin profile, or blog makes this less likely to happen.

mails extremely short. That way it’s easier to find the point of your email.

Don’t go into your regular spiel about <insert boring specialty>. Instead use words that they use to talk about their business. To find these words you can simply scan their job posting or website, steal their words, and mirror them back.


### The fastest way to win over a client

When you’re about to contact a lead, think about how you can make their problem go away. Don’t worry about giving away the farm. In fact, get to this crucial solution as quickly as possible and even give it to them for free. Know what plugin will solve their WordPress dilemma? Send it. Have a suggestion to get their project 80% of the results they’re looking for? Suggest it. 


### Is your email helpful?

Maybe the most important question to ask before you send the email is whether you’d be happy to receive it.

Nobody cares about great design. Nobody cares about clean code. Nobody wants to have the best content just to have it. It’s all about what it means for them.


### The email line that repels clients
>   “Let me know how I can help.”


### The "in-conversation" emails
You should put leads in different groups depending on what stage they’re in. You’ll want to follow-up with some leads more often than others. 


So how do you follow up with someone who’s replied favorably to your email? Simple. Ask one question:

>   “Hey! This sounds good. Are you looking to bring me on in the next month?”



If they respond that they’re looking to bring you on sometime in the next month, then you should begin talking about the project seriously. When you confirm the project will be happening soon, it’s time to schedule a call.

>   “OK great. I’ve structured similar projects with past clients in your situation a few  different ways. The best way to find out which one is right for you would be a 15 minute call where we can meet and discuss what you need. Does next week on X at X:00 work?”


On the other hand, some leads won’t have a project starting for a few months. If this is the case, move them to a “Staying in Touch” group and reply:

>   “aOK I’ll follow up with you then. I love X about your company so you’ll be high on my priority list.”



### The Followup
Here’s the sequence. You’ll be amazed at how simple it is:

First follow-up:

>   “Hey haven’t heard back from you on this, is it still something you’re looking to do?”

1 week later:

>   “Hey there, any update on this?”

3 days later:

>   “Hey is this project still a priority for you?”

At this point, if you haven’t heard back to your cold email it’s OK to end the conversation and walk away. However, you should let them know by sending one last email a week later:

>   “Hey there, since I have not heard from you on this, I have to assume your priorities have changed.”

That’s it, resist the urge to add anything else to this final email. The abrupt ending will cause clients to respond more often than not.  

By following this sequence alone you’ll see a huge increase in new clients. Use this sequence, most people won’t. 



### The Testimonial Email

The easiest way to get testimonials is by minimizing the client effort involved. When you’re coming close to the end of a project, send an email like this:

>    “Oh and by the way, I’m thinking of doing a case study about ProjectName on my website – with your permission. I would also love to include a testimonial from you about my work with CompanyName. Something like this would be perfect:
>
>    Using Robert’s design services to create a website that measurably attracts more customers is a guaranteed investment.
>
>    In fact, if you’re busy at the moment, I can use that quote for now. Either way, let me know. Thank you!”


## The referral email

Once I get a testimonial (which is basically an endorsement to the whole world), I’ll go in and ask directly for a referral:

>    “Hey,

>   Thanks for the testimonial. This was an awesome project.

>  I’d like to continue working with you. I have a few ideas for what we can do in the next few weeks to add to this project and make it even more successful.

>  I’ll send those over soon, but for now, if you know of anyone who would benefit from a similar service, I would love it if you could send me their email. I’ll let them know that you were thinking this might be right for them, and answer any questions they have about how your project worked out (I’ll also cc you on the email)!

>   Sound good?”


### How to end your emails

Freelancers regularly shoot themselves in the foot with their closing statement.

>  “I’m not sure if you may be interested in something like this, but if you are feel free to let me know what you would like to do.”

This does you no good. You’re trying to not sound pushy but you are undermining your credibility. Instead, emails should end in two things ways.

* A yes or no question.
* A suggested instructions on what to do next.

Or both.
