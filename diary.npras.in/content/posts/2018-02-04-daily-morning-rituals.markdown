Tim Ferriss has this pdf where he shares his daily morning ritual. Some of it makes sense. [Find it here](https://fhww.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/5-morning-rituals-that-help-me-win-the-day1.pdf).


__1. Make your bed__

As soon as I wake up, I want to fold the bedsheet and keep the pillows stacked. But I so want to take a dump that I can't do this right away. So this is actually is the 2nd thing I'm doing after waking up.

__2. Do 5 to 10 reps of something__

He says push ups. And just for 30 seconds. But I'm doing 10 sets of Sun Salutations. It takes only 3 minutes, but it takes forever to finish. I've already started hating it now, but I like how my body feels right after the routine. I feel nimble and active and my brain is alert with all the blood and oxygen flow. To mix variety, I might do some mobility routines seen in youtube.

__3. Meditate__

My throat's dry due to the tiny workout above. I'll make some hot water and drink it.  And then it's meditation time. 10 minutes using the excellent Calm app.

__4. Prepare some quality tea/coffee.__

Black, green, bullet, creamy whatever. (I can only make black tea/coffee. I need to learn to make the others) and then do the next step.

__5. 5-minute Journaling__

I'm yet to do this. But Tim idea is to do it twice - morning and night.


__The morning 5MJ:__

* I'm grateful for
* What would make today great
* Daily affirmations. I am...


__The night 5MJ:__

* 3 amazing things that happened today
* How could I've made today better

I'm also planning to add about 30 pushups into each day. 10 right after sun salutations, 10 after meditation and 10 after making coffee?

And whatsapp some positive messages to people I love. (Jamie Foxx said he does that in Tim's podcast. I'd love to do it.)

### Outro
This totally sucks. You'll drain your precious little willpower after doing these things and you won't have any when you sit to code, which is sort of the main purpose around getting up in the morning and doing things with purpose.

So, how then do I re-do?

Maybe right after journaling - I'll plan what I need to do for the day and get on with a non-stop 1 hr of work into my side project?
