I feel I have become slow in reinventing myself wrt career.

The Rails bandwagon has slowed down. Does that mean I have to start focusing on a new language framework?

I invested quite some time into Javascript in 2017. Learnt React and built 2 apps for one of my clients. 

Should I double down on JS this year? Go through react again, build some sample apps, get to know NodeJS?

Ugh. A look into the framework land of Javascript makes my head spin. I think I'd rather stick with rails and improve my ruby and server side coding here, while also learning and mastering ReactJS.

So it's a deal?

Ok. Be specific. What to improve?

* Object oriented programming (maybe I'll read Sandi Metz's books - POODR / 99 bottles of OOP)

* SQL: I invested time into learning PostgreSQL. I don't want it to go wasted. I want to learn more about it. Learn how to extract meaningful analysis out of data.

* React: go through the official doc again and re-learn everything

* Javascript: Learn new concepts like async/await, graphql etc (and what new dreaded things O Javascript?!)

* Go through all of GoRails and maybe build apps right with him to get a feel of what he's doing


Extraneous to coding, what else do I want to learn?

* I learnt CSS Grids, maybe learn about frontend site designing? Get a good book on design and maybe do that? In that case, I need to go through flexbox thing too.
* Copywriting? Duh. What am I selling first?
* Cooking. Hmm. This is a really serious thing. I want to learn more about cooking.

Wait this post isn't about cooking unless I'm going to become a chef.

That's it then.
